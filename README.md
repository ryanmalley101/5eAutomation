# 5e Automation

I'm undertaking a pretty large project that'll require making a ton of monsters, subclasses, maps, etc. 

Figured it would be a good time to make something that can help me automate that process.

## Description

This project is made to build, save, and convert D&D 5e resources like monsters, spells, and magic items. Most items are saved as JSON and all should be able to be converted into GMBinder markup format.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

PyQt6~=6.4.2
pandas~=1.4.2
numpy~=1.22.4

### Executing program

The main app is pretty straightforwardly
```
python3 app.py
```
